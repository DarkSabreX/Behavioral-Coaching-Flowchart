### Why?

During my time as a Learning Management System Administrator I identified several areas of platform usage and learning engagement that could be improved by use of customized UX/UI pages. While conversing with a co-worker, it was brought to my attention the difficulties our Coaching staff had with the static Behavioral Coaching Flowchart document they had been using.

I developed this interactive flowchart to help guide conversations and give the Coaching staff more tools to better support their agents.

### Language/Framework

Angular2

### Challenges/Solutions

This was designed for use in the Cornerstone LMS platform. While very powerful and robust, it is not designed for a client to perform deep HTML/JS customization on. By design the custom HTML components only allow for use of a sanitized subset of HTML and CSS tags. I developed a method to allow deployment of fully interactive pages using Angular2 as the JS framework by leveraging the Computer Based Training upload tools to house the HTML/JS files needed to deploy the pages.
